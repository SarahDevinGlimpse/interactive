		<h4> Writing Response: the never-ending present </h4>
		<p> When I was 8, my favorite website was barbie.com. The site still exists, technically. But all of the games I played are gone. They’ve been updated, phased out, replaced with games featuring new characters, from new franchises. I know it looks wrong; or, at least, it doesn’t look like it used to. But. I can’t quite picture what that “used to” looked like. Only that I was mostly pretty certain that it did indeed used to exist. When I was 17, I saw my sister use the wayback machine for an entirely unrelated purpose, and tried to use it to access the barbie.com of my memory. I was successful, kind of. But it was mostly unsatisfying. The site loaded. Slowly. The games ran. Slowly. It was less a copy of the site and more a memory of it, not entirely unlike my own. It created a strange sort of bittersweet time travel. In one way, it cemented the knowledge that I could never fully return to an early 2000s collection of shitty horse makeover games, or whatever I was playing. In another, it was evidence that such a site had existed, the mere visuals of it brought back the aftertaste of the joy said shitty horse makeover games used to bring me. It felt like watching a home video, recognizing the wallpaper in the house your grandma sold 15 years ago, recognizing that you used to know that information, recognizing that you don’t know it anymore and that you will never really “know” it again. You’ll only ever be able to retrieve the archive of it.</p>
