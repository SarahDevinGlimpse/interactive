    <li> Pour yourself 1 cup of boiling water. A clear canvas.</li><br>
    <li> Open up your tea chest and pick 1 teabag; OR mix your own loose leaf tea; OR steep 2 bags at once. The flavor is up to you. </li> <br>
    <li> The longer your tea bag steeps, the richer the flavor. Experiment with different steeping times. Everyone has their own. </li><br>
    <li> Add your personal touch. Perhaps you prefer one cube of sugar, or two. A splash of creamer. Skim milk, almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk. Honey and lemon. A sprinkling of cinnamon, perhaps. Mix in the add-ins of your choice. </li><br>
    <li> Not everyone takes their tea the same way. Take some time to figure out what you like before worrying about other people's tea tastes. </li>
